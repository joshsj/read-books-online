See [Projects](../../projects)

- Each board constitutes an epic
- Issues will have an expected label, e.g.,
  [bug](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug),
  [enhancement](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)
- An additional label may be added to identify its
  associated user story, prefixed with 'story: ', e.g.,
  "story: user roles"
